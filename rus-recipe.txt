If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.

If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password. For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating an SSH Key.
